Symbols:

Rock (Defeats Scissors and Lizard --- Defeated by Paper and Spock)
Paper (Defeats Rock and Spock --- Defeated by Scissors and Lizard)
Scissors (Defeats Paper and Lizard --- Defeated by Rock and Spock)
Lizard (Defeats Paper and Spock --- Defeated by Rock and Scissors)
Spock (Defeats Rock and Scissors --- Defeated by Paper and Lizard)

To Do:

Import everything to it's right place (symbol.py to each of the symbol files, each of the symbol files to main.py).
Make each of the symbols a subclass of the Symbol class.
Figure out and implement a way for the player to choose a symbol.
Write the code for the game in main.py

Ideas:

Write special phrases for each match (i.e., "Scissors has sliced through Paper, Player Wins!")
Figure out a way to make the computer opponent choose symbols based on past rounds (maybe).
